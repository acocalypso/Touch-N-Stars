# Setup wizard and location handling

`src/components/setupWizard/` is the cancellable first-run and equipment wizard.
It opens before setup is complete and is ordered ahead of the tutorial and
What's New. Cancel and finish are the same transaction — both call
`completeSetupWizard()`, so the app is usable either way.

## Adding a step

One entry in the computed `steps` list in `SetupWizard.vue:194`, plus one
`v-else-if` branch. Nothing else in the wizard shell is step-count aware.

The step order carries reasons, and they are written as comments next to the
entries — read them before reordering. The load-bearing ones:

- **Localization before Wi-Fi**, so the regulatory country, timezone, locale and
  remote keyboard layout are set before networking is configured.
- **Mount before location**, because the location sync needs a connected mount.
- **Telescope before camera**, because the camera step's image-scale readout
  needs `TelescopeSettings.FocalLength`.
- **Guiding last**, because PHD2 needs a connected mount and the dither
  calculator needs the camera and telescope values.

PINS-only steps (`localization`, `wifi`, `updates`, `slewRate`, `guider`) are
spliced in conditionally, which is why **steps are tracked by id, not by index**
(`currentStepId`): the list grows underneath the user when `isPINS` flips.
A persisted id that no longer exists falls back to index 0 rather than rendering
nothing.

The wizard hides itself while `pinsStore.shouldShowUpgradeOverlay` is true and
persists `settingsStore.setupWizard.currentStepId` — a PINS upgrade restarts
services and can temporarily interrupt the app connection.

## z-index staffing

Modals opened from inside the wizard teleport to `body`, so they need explicit
layering or they open invisibly *behind* it:

| Layer | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `Modal.vue` default | `z-40` |
| `LoadingOverlay` | `z-[60]` |
| **Wizard overlay** | `z-70` |
| Modals opened from the wizard | `z-[75]` |
| `LocationSyncModal` | `z-[76]` — it blocks the mount connect |
| PINS upgrade overlay, `DialogModal` | `z-[80]` |

`Indi3rdpartyInstallPanel.vue:19` documents this at the call site.

## Third-party INDI driver installs

`ALLOWED_INDI_DRIVER_TYPES` in
`src/plugins/pins/composables/indiInstallUtils.js:39` accepts eight types:
`camera, filterwheel, flatpanel, focuser, rotator, switches, telescope,
weather`. It must stay in sync with `TYPE_OPTIONS` in
`PinsIndiRegistryEditModal.vue:303` — the registry an installed driver is
written into. Both are currently identical; `dome` and `safetymonitor` are
covered by neither.

## Location handling

The refs in `src/utils/location.js` are **module singletons**
(`latitude`, `longitude`, `altitude`, `syncDirection`, `ninaCoords`,
`mountCoords`), shared between the wizard's location step and
`LocationSettingsPins.vue`. Always call `useLocationStore().loadFromAstrometrySettings()` when
entering a location UI instead of trusting what the previous screen left behind.

- `getCurrentLocation()` writes **strings** (`toFixed`). Use text inputs, not
  `NumberInputPicker`. `saveCoordinates()` sanitizes them, including a decimal
  comma.
- With `syncDirection === 'TOTELESCOPE'`, `saveCoordinates()` disconnects and
  reconnects the mount and takes PHD2 with it. That takes several seconds, so a
  loading flag is mandatory.
