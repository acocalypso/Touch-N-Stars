# 🤝 **Community-Powered, Forever Free: Donate to Cover Apple’s Developer Fee**

Our app is Open Source and will remain so - without advertising, without costs.
In order for it to be available in the Apple App Store, we need an annual developer license of 99 USD, which Apple requires.
Since we do not pursue any commercial interests, we would like to ask you, the community, for support.
If you would like to help us cover the costs, we would be happy about any donation:

Thank you for your support! 💜

### 🚀 **Current Status: Stable Version**

Touch’N’Stars is a stable and fully usable application designed for astronomy enthusiasts who want to conveniently control their equipment using NINA (Nighttime Imaging ‘N’ Astronomy) via touch-enabled devices.
The app is actively maintained and continuously improved, but it is no longer in a development or experimental phase. It is ready for regular use in real imaging sessions.

### 🏁 **Purpose of the WebApp**

The application makes controlling and configuring NINA- or PINS-based astrophotography rigs easier directly from a tablet or smartphone. This makes field setup, equipment configuration, and imaging-session control more mobile and convenient.

### 🧩 **Important Notes**

- Standard Windows operation requires a running NINA installation with the latest
  **Touch-N-Stars** and **Advanced API** plugins. PINS/headless rigs are supported
  as a separate runtime mode.
- Advanced API V2 must be enabled. Its port is discovered dynamically through the
  Touch-N-Stars plugin and does not need to be fixed to `1888`.
- For Three Point Polar Alignment, version 2.2.2.0 or newer is required.
- It is intended as a complement to the desktop software and provides mobile support for basic functions.
- The author assumes no liability

### 🔧 **Installation**

- Please take a look at the instructions in our [WIKI](https://github.com/Touch-N-Stars/Touch-N-Stars/wiki/Touch'N'Stars-Wiki#-important-notes)

### 📱 **Android App**

- We have created an app for Android users.
- You can find the app on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TouchNStars.dev)

### 📱 **iOS App**

- You can find the app in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/touch-n-stars/id6744902856)

#### Building locally on macOS

With Xcode and CocoaPods installed, run from the repository root:

```sh
npm ci
npm run ios:run
```

`ios:run` uses the Ionic CLI to build the web app and sync native plugins, then
Xcode to compile, sign, install, and launch the **App** scheme on the connected
iPhone. Unlock the phone and enable Developer Mode. If multiple devices are
connected, select one with `npm run ios:run -- "iPhone name"` or its UDID.
This also handles devices visible to Xcode/CoreDevice but missing from Ionic's
`native-run` device list. Build products are kept in `ios/DerivedData`.

To open the workspace manually instead:

```sh
npx ionic capacitor build ios --no-open
npx cap open ios
```

If the geolocation dependency needs refreshing:

```sh
cd ios/App
pod update CapacitorGeolocation IONGeolocationLib --repo-update
cd ../..
npx cap sync ios
```

Build the **App** scheme in `App.xcworkspace`. After updating native plugins,
use Xcode's **Product → Clean Build Folder** before rebuilding. Geolocation
is pinned to `8.2.3` with `IONGeolocationLib 3.0.0`. If Xcode reports missing
`trueHeading`, `magneticHeading`, or `headingAccuracy` in
`IONGLOCPositionModel+JSONTransformer`, refresh the native pods with the command
above; `cap copy` alone does not update native dependencies. If that error
persists, run `pod cache clean IONGeolocationLib --all` inside `ios/App`, repeat
the pod update, and clean the Xcode build folder again.

### 🧪 **What does the Version offer?**

- **Mobile Operation**: Easily access NINA through your smartphone or tablet.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Simple and intuitive interface specifically optimized for mobile devices.
- **Focus on Practical Features**: Support for essential steps in setting up your equipment.

### Celestia Atlas sky pointing (native apps)

Tap the Atlas compass to follow the direction your phone is aimed, looking
through the back of its screen. Tap again or drag the map to stop. Pinch zoom
keeps your chosen field of view. The compass is highlighted while tracking.

Sky pointing uses your configured observing site, or requests foreground location
only if no valid site exists. iOS may request motion access. Sensor readings are
processed locally. Magnetic interference can affect alignment: move away from
metal and magnets and calibrate the compass with a figure-eight motion.
Browsers and devices without a north-referenced motion sensor retain manual
navigation. Enable **Show compass** in Atlas settings if the control is hidden.

This feature requires a rebuilt native app; a web asset update alone is insufficient.
See [local build instructions, accuracy limits, and validation status](docs/sky-pointing.md).
