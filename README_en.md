# 🤝 **Community-Powered, Forever Free: Donate to Cover Apple’s Developer Fee**

Our app is Open Source and will remain so - without advertising, without costs.
In order for it to be available in the Apple App Store, we need an annual developer license of 99 USD, which Apple requires.
Since we do not pursue any commercial interests, we would like to ask you, the community, for support.
If you would like to help us cover the costs, we would be happy about any donation:

Thank you for your support! 💜
