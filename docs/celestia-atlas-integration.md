# Celestia Atlas integration guide

This document is the current engineering contract for Celestia Atlas inside
Touch'N'Stars. The longer [migration log](celestia-atlas-migration.md) preserves
implementation history and evidence; it should not be used as the setup guide.

## Ownership and dependency

Touch'N'Stars owns the Vue UI, persistence, N.I.N.A. adapters, native lifecycle,
and packaged survey routing. The `@acocalypso/celestia-atlas` package owns sky
rendering, interaction, catalogue search, projections, ephemerides, and its
framework-neutral viewer API.

The dependency in `package.json` is pinned to an immutable Git commit. To update
it:

1. Commit, test, and push Celestia Atlas first.
2. Replace the commit after `#` in `package.json`.
3. Run `npm install` once to update `package-lock.json`.
4. Review that both lockfile entries resolve to the same commit.
5. Run `npm ci` and the validation matrix below.

Do not import Atlas internals. All host imports must come from its public package
entry point, and a public API change must update the engine declarations and
documentation before the host pin moves.

## Runtime boundary

`src/views/CelestiaAtlasView.vue` creates the viewer only after first use. The
warm instance remains mounted, is paused while hidden or while the native app is
backgrounded, and is resized/resumed when visible. Permanent unmount destroys
the viewer and its listeners.

Host-specific adapters live in `src/integrations/celestiaAtlas/`; renderer UI
lives in `src/components/celestiaAtlas/`. Keep coordinate conversion, catalogue
assembly, survey URL resolution, and selection normalization out of the view
when they can be pure and tested.

The host supplies:

- observer location and synchronized N.I.N.A. UTC;
- mount position, locate/follow state, and connection freshness;
- camera sensor geometry, telescope focal length, aperture, rotation, and
  mosaic settings;
- landscape, horizon, display, magnitude, type, and catalogue filters;
- selected-target actions and Framing Assistant cache previews.

The camera panel also hosts the framing tools (favourites list, FITS plate
solve, mosaic controls). Mosaic panel centres saved as favourites are computed
in `src/integrations/celestiaAtlas/mosaicPanels.js` by replaying the package's
own FOV drawing (`projectAngularExtent`, `cameraFrameScreenRotationDeg`,
`unprojectEquatorial`) on a synthetic view, so they always match the drawn
rectangles. Targets loaded "into framing" elsewhere bump
`framingStore.framingReloadKey`; the Atlas centres on
`framingStore.RAangle/DECangle` when visible, or on its next open.

The Atlas settings dialog also exposes a manual comet refresh. Touch'N'Stars downloads
the `comets.json` asset from Atlas's rolling `comet-data-live` GitHub release
through the selected plugin server's `/api/proxy` endpoint (avoiding browser
CORS restrictions), validates the release envelope, replaces the viewer's
runtime orbital elements, and caches the last valid payload for offline reuse.

## Catalogue and naming contract

Touch'N'Stars composes the package's normalized base catalogue with the A66 and
Stellarium supplement layers. The resulting offline catalogue contains 21,192
deep-sky markers and exposes ten catalogue filters, including `messier`.

Stellar layers use the public `composeStarCatalog` helper with HYG curated
cross-identifiers/search-only entries, SAO cross-identifiers and WR data. This
matches the standalone atlas's 9,437 searchable stars without duplicating
cross-matched identities. HD and SAO are identifiers for bundled stars, not full
HD/SAO surveys. Star-group filters are independent of the DSO visibility switch,
persist in settings, and support overlapping group membership. The magnitude
slider reaches 20; unknown-magnitude stars appear only when selected from search.
Search remains unfiltered, and only catalogue-backed photographic stars are clickable.

The search-to-selection adapter must retain `uid`, `searchOnly` and
`crossIdSources`. The renderer supports the adapter's nested `coordinates`
payload for search-only markers. Regression targets are Sirius / SAO151881,
WR104 (measured magnitude) and WR99 (unknown magnitude), including reopening
the details card by clicking the centred marker after dismissing it.

- The normalized base must contain exactly one object for every designation
  from M1 through M110. Package updates that break this invariant must fail the
  host catalogue tests.
- Atlas owns canonical display labels. Search results and selected-object cards
  use `displayName` when present, so a common name cannot hide its designation:
  for example, `M81 · Bode's Galaxy` and `M42 · Great Orion Nebula`.
- `name` remains the command/framing name. Do not send the decorated
  `displayName` to N.I.N.A. as the target identity.
- M40 is represented as the SIMBAD-sourced Winnecke 4 double-star point marker.
  M102 follows the Atlas-documented NGC 5866 convention. Attribution and the
  historical ambiguity are maintained in the Atlas source manifest and notices.

## Coordinate and command contract

- Public RA/Dec is decimal degrees tagged `ICRS` or `J2000`.
- RA is normalized to `[0, 360)` and declination is within `[-90, 90]`.
- Observer longitude is positive east; elevation is metres.
- Time is UTC Unix milliseconds.
- Azimuth is measured north through east and Atlas altitude is geometric.
- N.I.N.A. command coordinates are J2000. ICRS selections are converted once at
  the integration boundary; JNOW mount samples are precessed before display.
- Untagged, unsupported-epoch, or non-finite values must clear stale command
  data and disable slew, centre, rotate, sequence, and favourite actions.

Never infer a coordinate frame from a field name. Extend
`src/integrations/celestiaAtlas/contracts.js` and its reference-vector tests for
any new coordinate source.

## Offline data and native delivery

Web and N.I.N.A.-served builds resolve landscapes and the DSS HiPS survey under
`/celestia-atlas-data`. The photographic survey is not part of the repository or
the app bundle: the user downloads it once from the Atlas settings, and the
Touch'N'Stars plugin server fetches the tiles (orders 3–4, optionally up to 7)
onto the N.I.N.A. host and serves them from its persistent data directory at
`/celestia-atlas-data/surveys/dss`. The app reads `hips_order` from the served
`properties` file (`loadDssSurveyOrder` in `offlineSkySurvey.js`) and keeps the
layer off while nothing is installed; it has no public online fallback.
Catalogue search, ephemerides, and engine calculations are local: star and
deep-sky catalogues are bundled through the `@acocalypso/celestia-atlas` data
modules, not served as files. `public/celestia-atlas-data` therefore holds only
the two shipped landscapes (`gray`, `guereins`); the former Stellarium-era HiPS
folders (`dso`, `stars`, `surveys/milkyway`, `surveys/sso`) and orbital element
files were removed and nothing loads them.

Android and iOS builds deliberately exclude `celestia-atlas-data`; they obtain
that tree from the selected Touch'N'Stars N.I.N.A. plugin server. The data-base
URL is resolved in `offlineSkySurvey.js` and the view, not hard-coded in the
renderer. Keep these invariants together:

- `EXCLUDE_CELESTIA_ATLAS_DATA=true` for native builds;
- `verify:native-atlas`/`verify:native-platforms` must pass;
- no remote survey fallback may be introduced;
- survey and catalogue attribution stays available in the About UI and notices.

Generated custom landscapes are plugin-managed user data, not release assets.
Current plugins serve them from
`/celestia-atlas-data/user-landscapes/<folder>` while storing the files outside
their replaceable installation directory. Persisted custom URLs from the former
`stellarium-data/landscapes` and `celestia-atlas-data/landscapes` locations are
migrated to this route. The packaged `touchnstars` (default, generated by
`scripts/generate-tns-landscape.py`), `gray` and `guereins` landscapes remain
under `/celestia-atlas-data/landscapes` and must not be redirected.

## UI and mobile contract

- Atlas overlays must stay below the application header and above the status
  bar/navigation area in both orientations.
- Primary touch controls are at least 48 by 48 CSS pixels.
- Search, mount locate/follow, time, play/pause, settings, About, share, and
  fullscreen controls must remain reachable at narrow widths.
- Pause and resume must not recreate the viewer, reload settled survey tiles, or
  lose the view.
- Pointer cancellation, pinch zoom, orientation resize, and app background/
  foreground transitions require explicit regression checks.

## Validation matrix

Run for every integration update:

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:run
npm run format:check
npm run build
```

The typecheck may require `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=6144` (PowerShell:
`$env:NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=6144'`) to avoid Node's default heap
limit on the complete application graph.

Run `npm run testbuild` for the Windows/N.I.N.A. deployment path. While the
N.I.N.A. plugin server is running, test at `http://localhost:5000` with browser
console and network panels open. Missing live PINS endpoints are expected without N.I.N.A.;
Atlas/Vue exceptions, unhandled promises, repeated tile requests, and missing
packaged assets are not.

For native-affecting work:

```bash
npm run build:native
npm run sync:native
```

Then verify Android and iOS with the selected N.I.N.A. instance reachable:

- first open, hide/show, background/foreground, rotate, and return navigation;
- drag follows the horizon, pinch zoom works, and polar DSO extents stay fixed;
- search and select OpenNGC, Abell/ACO, LDN/LBN, stars, and moving objects;
- mount marker, locate/follow, camera/mosaic FOV, and target command actions;
- downloaded survey stability while dragging and after settling, offline from
  the public internet;
- horizon/cardinals, landscape seam, Milky Way orientation, settings, and About;
- safe-area placement at small portrait and landscape viewports.

## Completion status

The Stellarium-to-Celestia functional migration is complete. Browser validation,
native package-boundary checks, Android assembly, and physical Android/iOS
hardware testing have passed. The hardware pass was confirmed on 2026-07-22 and
closes the native lifecycle, gesture, layout, offline-data, visual, mount/FOV,
and iOS compile/install/run gates.

The remaining work is non-blocking validation evidence:

- repeat the completed three-run physical Android memory baseline on a physical
  iOS release device with Instruments, using the
  [native memory profiling protocol](native-atlas-memory-profiling.md).

This does not represent missing renderer functionality. The current FITS, WCS,
plate-solve, manual, favourite, and sequence rotation paths are covered by the
[position-angle contract](celestia-atlas-position-angle-contract.md); new image
metadata must satisfy its admission checklist before automatic use.

## Troubleshooting

- **Blank survey:** check the Atlas settings for an installed survey first, then
  verify the selected N.I.N.A. base URL and request
  `/celestia-atlas-data/surveys/dss/properties` from the same device (404 means
  nothing is installed on that host).
- **Tiles flicker or refetch:** inspect request URLs and response cache headers;
  confirm viewer lifecycle is pausing/resuming rather than remounting.
- **Mount absent:** inspect epoch and finite RA/Dec validation before changing
  renderer code.
- **Search result absent:** search ignores display filters; verify that the lazy
  catalogue layer loaded and its identifier normalization test exists.
- **Native bundle too large:** run `npm run verify:native-platforms` and confirm
  no `celestia-atlas-data` directory entered either platform asset tree.
- **Slow lint:** use `npm run lint`; it is source-scoped and cached. Do not lint
  generated `dist`, native, deployment, or `.cache` trees.

## Licences and terminology

Celestia Atlas engine code is MIT licensed, while individual catalogue and image
sources retain their own terms. Keep the pinned engine notices and application
acknowledgements aligned whenever the dependency or data changes. “Stellarium”
may remain in historical migration notes or migrated preference keys, but must
not describe the active renderer or current UI.
